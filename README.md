## FreeCodeCamp: Build a Tic Tac Toe Game

I built an interactive Tic Tac Toe Game with JavaScript, jQuery, HTML and CSS, while following some best practices for structuring HTML, writing efficient CSS, and commenting code along the way.

 User can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.  The game will reset as soon as it's over so user can play again.  User can choose whether to play as X or O.
